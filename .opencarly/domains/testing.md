# Testing Rules

Activated when writing or discussing tests.

- Write tests alongside the code they test
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Include edge cases: empty input, null values, boundary conditions
- Keep tests independent - no shared mutable state between tests
- Use arrange-act-assert (AAA) pattern for test structure
- Mock external dependencies, not internal modules
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100% line coverage
