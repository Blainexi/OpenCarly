# Development Rules

Activated when writing, modifying, or discussing code.

- Code over explanation - show, don't tell
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use targeted edits and diffs rather than rewriting entire files
- Follow the language's idiomatic patterns and conventions
- Handle errors explicitly - don't silently swallow exceptions
- Add types/interfaces for function parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused - one responsibility per function
- Name variables and functions descriptively
- Consider edge cases: null, undefined, empty arrays, concurrent access
