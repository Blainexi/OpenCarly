# Global Rules

These rules apply to every prompt, regardless of context.

- Use absolute paths when referencing files in the project
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When making changes, show the minimal diff needed
- Read files before editing to understand current state
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
- If a task is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding
- When multiple approaches exist, briefly mention alternatives
- Commit messages should be concise and describe the WHY, not the WHAT
- Do not add comments that merely restate what the code does
